ML application for text summarization

## Overview
The Text Summarization Application generates concise summaries from input text. It leverages natural language processing models to extract key information and condense lengthy passages into shorter summaries. This application is useful for quickly extracting essential points from articles, reports, documents, and more.

## Technologies used
The ML model used in this application is sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6. Fast API is used as the backend to serve the NLP model. The UI is built using Streamlit.
The core functionality of the application is text summarization. Users input text into the Streamlit UI, and upon submission, the text is sent to the FastAPI backend. The backend processes the text using the pretrained NLP model and returns a summarized version of the input text.
The summarized text generated by the model is displayed back to the user via the Streamlit UI.

## Usage
1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload

    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Access the application in web browser at http://localhost:8501.
   
3. Enter the text you want to summarize into the input field.

4. Click the "Summarize" button to generate a summary.

5. View the summarized text in the application output.
